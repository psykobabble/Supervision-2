                <h4>A Question based Approach to Supervision</h4> 
                  <p>One of the aims of supervision is to help people to find new version fo the situation or work-related scenario that has become stuck. This may be achieved by asking questions that invite change. The following approach seems to produce the most helpful outcomes.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Do not give advice unless absolutelely necessary.</li>
                    <li>Do not offer solutions until absolutely necessary.</li>
                    <li>Do not make interpretations of people's behaviour or motives.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Supervision may sometimes require a less open and more directive or guidance based approach than this. Tomm (1988) suggests asking different kinds of questions which can help people think from new angles. These techniques and ways of asking questions have been formulated into some core concepts, the seven Cs (adapted from Launer, 2006), which illustrates how to put supervision into practice. These are summarised in the following sections with reference to both educational and clinical supervision.</p>

                <div class='panel'>  
                    <h4>Conversations</h4>  
                    <p>This implies that the conversation itself is the working tool. Effective conversations don't just describe people's view of reality, they create new understanding of it through the opportunity for peopl to rethink and reconstruct their stories.</p>  
                </div>
                <div class='panel'>  
                    <h4>Curiosity</h4>  
                    <p>This is the factor that changes chat into a more substantial conversation. It is used to develop the story about colleagues and oneself. It invlovles paying close attention to both verbal and non-verbal language. It includes curiosity about the supervisor's own responses; feelings of criticism, boredom, anxiety, etc. An important feature is taking a position of neutrality. This concept is similar to that of being non-judgemental, but taking a neutral stance allows us acknowldge our own position as well as becomgin curious about the different positions others might take, including the position of no change.</p>  
                </div>
                <div class='panel'>  
                    <h4>Contexts</h4>  
                    <p>This develops an understanding of the person's networks, workplace values, their sense of culture, faith, beliefs, community,  history and geography, and how these may impinge on the case presented. An important context is that of how power is understood (see below). Who holds the power and how is it seen by others? Who is asking for supervision and for what purpose? Understanding the different contexts of all the people or organisations involved is key to developing effective supervision conversations and making them come alive.</p>  
                </div>
                <div class='panel'>  
                    <h4>Complexity</h4>  
                    <p>This involves thinking about things in a non-linear fashion, getting away from fixed ideas of cause and effect. It is a way of becoming more interested in interactions between people and the kind of patterns that develop between people and events over time to produce a richer description of the story.</p>  
                </div>
                <div class='panel'>  
                    <h4>Creativity</h4>  
                    <p>This means finding a way to create a story or account of reality that makes better sense for people than the one they are going through. To do this involves using oneself, intuition and sensitivity to fine-tune the conversation. It also implies a the creative process of jointly constructing a new version of the story through the process of supervision.</p>  
                </div>
                <div class='panel'>  
                    <h4>Caution</h4>  
                    <p>This consists of looking for cues from the supervisee to monitor their responses. It invloves working on the cusp between affirmation and perturbation in order to get an appropriate level of challenge without being confrontational and without being too bland. Sometimes it may be appropriate to give straightforward advice (although you need to be aware of its limitations).</p>  
                </div>
                <div class='panel'>  
                    <h4>Care</h4>  
                    <p>This encomapsses being respectful, considerate and attentive to supervisees and yourself. It means ensuring that the work is carried out within an ethical framework.</p>
